### Step 3: Add More Articles

Repeat the process above for each new article. For the **featured article** (the one that appears in "New" section):
- Set `featured: true`
- Set `timestamp` to the current time

For **latest news articles**:
- Set `featured: false`
- Set `timestamp` to an earlier time

### Step 4: How the Auto-Rotation Works

1. **Featured Article**: The article with the most recent `timestamp`
2. **Latest News**: All other articles, ordered by `timestamp`
3. **To make a new article featured**: 
   - Add a new article with `featured: true`
   - Set `timestamp` to current time
   - The old featured article automatically becomes "Latest News"

```
